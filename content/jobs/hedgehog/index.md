- I have been crucially involved in developing and improving Stocknet Institute's online platform - a renowned UK-based proprietary trading firm. My contributions focus on enabling seamless access to proprietary trading for traders across the globe, with instant funding options, and minimal formalities.
- Trading Dashboard: Developed an interactive control panel and comprehensive trading history section for the dashboard. This enabled users to manage their active plans, track their progress, make informed decisions with real-time data on live and historic trades, and efficiently interact with features like weekly withdrawals and plan scaling.
- Notifications Feed: Constructed a real-time notification system to enhance traders' engagement and response to relevant events. This system presents a clear, concise list of personalised notifications, providing immediate and meaningful context to help traders understand and action any outstanding issues
